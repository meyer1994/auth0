Learning to use [auth0][1] coupled with [Vue][2]

## About

I created this project to learn how to use Vue, with [VueRouter][3] and
[Vuex][4] in order to create an authenticated SPA.

:warning: I am not sure if this approach is the best one. If you end up using
this implementation, use it at your own risk.

## Install

Install everything!

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start a local, development, server:

```
npm run serve
```
